* sum all values of 'a' between 1 and upper
* 17.04.2018 02:26:57
		upper = 6
		a = 0
loop    sq = a * a
		output = lt(a,upper) output + (a = a + 1) + sq :s(loop)
* treat <lt(a,upper)>  as a sort of predicate

		&DUMP = 1
end
* unexpected effect : wanted to create extra column with the square 
* of the sum
